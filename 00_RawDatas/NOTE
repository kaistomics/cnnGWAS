1. Input file format
Input file should be a tab delimited text file with 6 columns.  
All coordinates are based on hg19 (GRCh37). 
Each of the columns MUST have a header row named as follows: 
#snpid	chr	bp	a1	a2	zscore

The GWAS summary statistics files can include different information;
In most cases, z-score can be calculated from given information. 

Example input summary statistics file is included in this folder:
"AUTsummary.hg19.txt"


2. Input file name
We recommend simple file prefix, preferably disease name (e.g. SLE), ALWAYS followed by .txt extension.
Underbar "_" MUST NOT be included inside a file prefix(e.g. PSY_AUT_dis.txt), since it will cause string processing error. 
example file names: "SLE.txt", "MDD2019.txt"
