Following variables in RUN.sh script can be adjusted, although defalut value is recommended. 

1. SigPVal
Indicates the cutoff for selecting lead SNPs. 
If summary statistics include a large number of genome-wide significant loci (e.g. significantly more than 100 loci), more significant value may be needed (e.g. 5e-08).

2. CUTOFF
Indicates the feature filtering cutoff. If value is higher, more features will be filtered out.
